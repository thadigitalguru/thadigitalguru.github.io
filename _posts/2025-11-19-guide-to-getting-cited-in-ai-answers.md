The first time I built my first blog website for SEO, I made sure to optimize it for keywords that could generate some AdSense revenue. I stuffed keywords wherever I deemed fit, low-key knowing that I could never "rank" for that keyword, but also hoping Google might accidentally rank my worthless articles on some long-tail words.

As Google's algorithms advanced, those crude optimization tactics have become obsolete, yet the core formula for visibility stayed the same: create content with targeted keywords and get links.

The rise of AI in search has progressively rendered brute-force SEO tactics obsolete and transformed how people search websites. As a result, companies, marketers, and agencies are now racing to redefine the playbook for visibility in an AI-driven landscape.

Well, allow me to burst your bubble.

There exists no single silver bullet!

Many of these new playbooks fall back into formulaic tactics that disconnect users from the true optimization process. Some so‑called "experts" insist that spamming Reddit with links and citations is the future, while others simply rebrand old link‑building and digital PR as AI citation building. Still, some are taking a more calculated approach, generating citations across sites they own or tightly control.

There is no shortcut to immediate AI visibility. While some of these tactics are effective for visibility, if they are not aligned with user value, they will cease to be effective.

LLMs learn to identify and disregard old tactics that worked a few weeks or months before. It's like racing against someone who studies all your moves and gets faster with every round.

So if the old tactics don't work, what actually works? The answer is simpler than expected, but it demands creativity and skill.

Your products and services must actually embody the brand identity you claim to be.

If let's say you are doing marketing for a cake shop. You can't just optimize your way to the best cake shop in your city. You need to have the best cake!

Aside from links and keywords on your website, LLMs pick up conversations from social media. So, if you somehow found yourself on the list of best cake shops without truly deserving the spot, they would demote you from the list after referencing conversations from the conversational aspect.

The most effective way to rank with LLM visibility is to genuinely deserve that spot.

Brand building is now a crucial part of your SEO if AI visibility is your goal. On top of that, your website and content must offer real value; AI favors thoroughness and accuracy because that's what people actually seek.

Link building is no longer about obtaining high authority links. Double down on building genuine relationships. Contribute and publish thought-leadership articles in reputable industry outlets, regardless of domain metrics. Share insights on socials that spark real conversations. While these exchanges might not immediately boost LLM visibility, they often lead to further dialogue that can. Leveraging influencers can also be a powerful approach for improving SEO.

Even better, go beyond digital—share your insights at key industry conferences. These efforts help build a reputation that both people and AI recognize. As credible sources begin to mention, link to, and reference your work, you develop an authentic network of authority. AI systems are built to detect these credibility signals and will increasingly recommend your brand as a trusted resource.

Brand building outlasts algorithm shifts.

By committing to giving genuine value, you earn trust from both AI systems and real people. While this approach demands more dedication than outdated shortcuts, it yields far greater returns. A reputation built on genuine brand strength endures algorithm updates and technological shifts—it grows even more robust. Your NPS score ultimately matters more than domain authority.

The businesses that will succeed in 2026 and beyond are those that abandon shortcuts and invest in creating something genuine. They transform into real brands that earn true recommendations, making them difficult for competitors to imitate. Authentic tactics that boost AI visibility remain valuable—but only when they align with the true nature of the brand. Avoid the temptation of short-term hacks.

Brand building benefits more than just LLM visibility—it's a smart business move. SEO has operated in isolation, with its own set of metrics and objectives, for too long. Now, AI is pushing SEO to reconnect with its core role in marketing.
